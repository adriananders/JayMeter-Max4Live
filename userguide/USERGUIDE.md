<h1>User Guide</h1>

Inspired by the humanized and offbeat sounds of Hip-Hop and IDM productions, JayMeter is a 16-step timing and dynamics sequencer for Ableton Live with Max 4 Live. It is a MIDI effect which does not produce MIDI notes on its own. Rather MIDI notes need to be fed from either Ableton's sequencer or external MIDI fed through Ableton. JayMeter then transforms the timing and velocity (dynamics) of the MIDI notes, pushing the results out through the other end of the MIDI effect slot.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
  <ul>Ableton Live 9</ul>
  <ul>Max 4 Live 7</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

Add the file [JayMeter-Definitive.amxd](/devices/JayMeter-Definitive.amxd) to your favorite Max 4 Live MIDI effects path.<br>
Drag & drop the patch into an available MIDI channel with or without an existing plugin instrument.<br>
By default, the device is enabled but does not produce a noticable effect on incoming MIDI.<br>
Modify the behavior of the incoming MIDI by changing the value dials as follows.<br>

<h2>Tips, Tricks, & Recommendations</h2>
  <ul>JayMeter is capable of extreme settings, please be aware of this with initial usage. Start with small changes.</ul>
  <ul>Start with constructed Ableton sequences rather than played-through external MIDI to debug settings.</ul>
